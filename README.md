Step 1: Download & Explore the Dataset
	• Get the dataset from Amazon Review Data. (Amazon Reviews'23) 
     https://huggingface.co/datasets/McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023
     https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/index.html#
	• Choose a specific category (e.g., Books, Electronics, Clothing).
	• Understand the data structure (User ID, Product ID, Ratings, Reviews, etc.).

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
	• Remove duplicates & missing values.
	• Convert timestamps to readable datetime format.
	• Filter data (e.g., only products with at least 5 reviews).
	• Normalize text reviews (lowercase, remove special characters, stopwords).
  • Data visualization using Tabelu or Matplotlib.
  • Build a SQL/No-SQL Database.

Step 3: Feature Engineering
	• User-item interaction matrix (users vs. products they rated).
	• Extract text embeddings from reviews using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT.
	• Create categorical features like product category, brand, price range.

Step 4: Build/Use Pre-trained LLM for Recommendation Models
1. LLM-Powered Collaborative Filtering:
  • Use LLM embeddings to encode user review history and find similar users based on semantic meaning rather than just numerical ratings.
  • Use Transformer-based embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa, or OpenAI’s embeddings) to compare users with similar purchase behaviors.
  • Generate personalized recommendations based on historical interactions, allowing for a more nuanced similarity measure.
2. LLM-Powered Content-Based Filtering:
  • Extract rich semantic features from review text using LLMs like BERT, GPT, or T5.
  • Perform text similarity search (e.g., SBERT + Cosine Similarity) to recommend similar products based on their review content and descriptions.
  • Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify key aspects like brand, features, or sentiment to enhance recommendations.
3. LLM-Augmented Hybrid Recommendation Model:
  • Combine user behavior patterns (collaborative filtering) with deep text understanding (LLMs) to generate more personalized and context-aware suggestions.
  • Use LLMs to generate embeddings for both users and products and apply nearest neighbor search (FAISS, Annoy) for efficient retrieval.
  • Generate explainable recommendations by leveraging LLM-generated summaries to highlight why a product is being recommended.
4. LLM-Based Conversational Recommendations:
  • Use LLMs (GPT, LLaMA, Mistral) for an interactive recommendation chatbot where users can ask for product suggestions in natural language.
  • Implement dialogue-based preference learning, where the model refines recommendations based on user queries and feedback.
5. Sentiment & Emotion-Aware Recommendations:
  • Use LLMs for sentiment analysis and emotion classification to filter and adjust recommendations based on user mood.
  • Products with highly positive reviews (based on LLM interpretation) can be given higher weight.

Step 5: Train the Model & Evaluate Performance
- Fine-Tune or Embed with Pre-trained LLMs
  • Train on Amazon review text using LoRA, PEFT, or full fine-tuning (if needed).
  • Use embeddings (e.g., BERT, SBERT, or OpenAI) for similarity-based recommendations.
- Evaluation Metrics for Recommendation Models
  • Hit Rate (HR), Precision@K, Recall@K – Measures how often the correct items appear in the top-K recommendations.
  • NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) – Evaluate ranking quality by considering position relevance.
  • MAP (Mean Average Precision), MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) – Measures ranking performance for relevance-based recommendations.
A/B Testing & Real-World Validation
  • Compare different models (Collaborative, Content-Based, LLM) using offline validation.
  • Conduct user testing or interactive A/B tests to gauge effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
  • Analyze user engagement, conversion rates, and click-through rates (CTR) for deployed recommendations.

Step 6: Deploy as a Recommendation API
	• Use FastAPI to create an endpoint for recommendations.
	• Implement a request-response structure for user-product recommendations.

Step 7: Containerization & Deployment
	• Dockerize the API to make it portable.
	• Use Kubernetes for scalability.
	• Deploy on Streamlit or other for real-world applications.
